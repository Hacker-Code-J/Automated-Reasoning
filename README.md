## About Automated Reasoning

Automated Reasoning is a field of computer science and mathematical logic dedicated to understanding different aspects of reasoning. It involves the use of computers to perform logical tasks such as proving theorems, making logical inferences, and solving puzzles. Automated reasoning plays a crucial role in various applications, including formal verification, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.
