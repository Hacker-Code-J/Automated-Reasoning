\subsection{Introduction to Automated Theorem Proving}
Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) is a critical area within automated reasoning that focuses on the development of computer programs capable of proving mathematical theorems automatically. ATP systems are designed to assist mathematicians, logicians, and computer scientists in validating the correctness of propositions and theorems without human intervention.

The boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is the following: given a formula $F$ on propositional variables, does there exists an assignment $\mathcal{A}$ on theses variables, such that $\mathcal{A}(F)=1$.

Given a formula $F$ over a set of propositional variables $\set{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n}$, \[
\exists\mathcal{A}:\set{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n}\to\set{0,1}:\mathcal{A}(F)=1.
\]
